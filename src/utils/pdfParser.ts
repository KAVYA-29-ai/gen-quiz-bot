          Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
          
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
          that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any 
          machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
          
          Types of AI:
          1. Narrow AI (Weak AI) - AI that is designed to perform a narrow task
          2. General AI (Strong AI) - AI with generalized human cognitive abilities
          3. Superintelligence - AI that surpasses human intelligence in all areas
          
          Applications of AI:
          - Machine Learning and Data Analytics
          - Natural Language Processing
          - Computer Vision and Image Recognition
          - Robotics and Automation
          - Expert Systems and Decision Support
          
          Key Concepts:
          Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically 
          learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is 
          a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
          
          Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist 
          of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information using a connectionist approach.
          
          Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, 
          interpret and manipulate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication 
          and computer understanding.
          
          Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. 
          It involves methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images.
          
          Conclusion:
          AI continues to evolve and transform various industries. Understanding its fundamentals 
          is crucial for anyone working in technology today. The future of AI holds immense 
          potential for solving complex problems and improving human life.
